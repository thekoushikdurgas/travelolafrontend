OLA Maps API Interface
Overview
The OLA Maps API Interface is a Streamlit-based application designed to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface for navigating various map-related APIs. It allows users to explore functionalities such as elevation, geocoding, geofencing, places, roads, routing, and more. The project is structured to facilitate easy expansion and integration of additional APIs.

Project Structure
Files and Directories
app.py:
Main entry file that initializes the Streamlit app and handles the main navigation sidebar for selecting different API functionalities.
components/:
Contains individual modules for each API functionality, which are dynamically loaded based on user selection in the app interface.
page/:
Includes additional Streamlit pages or components that can be dynamically included into the main app.
test.py:
Provides test cases for the application's functionalities (not detailed here).
init.py:
Marks directories as Python packages, allowing for modular imports.
Components
Each component in the components directory corresponds to a specific API functionality:

Elevation, Geocode, Geofence, Health Check, Pincode, Placedetails, Places, Roads, Routing, Tiles:
These files implement the interface elements and backend API calls for their respective APIs.
Architecture
The application employs a modular architecture with a main script (app.py) that dynamically loads components based on user input. This approach not only makes the application scalable but also enhances maintainability by separating functionality into distinct modules.

Setup and Installation
Install Streamlit via pip:
Copy
pip install streamlit
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Run the application:
arduino
Copy
streamlit run app.py
Usage
Select the desired API functionality from the sidebar to interact with different APIs. Each section provides specific inputs relevant to the API selected and displays the results directly in the interface.

Contribution
Contributions to extend functionalities or enhance the existing application are welcome. Please follow standard fork-and-pull request workflow for contributions.
